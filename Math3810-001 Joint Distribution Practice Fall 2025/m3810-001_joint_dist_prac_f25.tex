	    \item[(a)] Find the joint pmf $p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$.

Given the four-point distribution, the marginals follow by summing the joint probabilities. Independence fails because $p_{X,Y}(0,0)\neq p_X(0)p_Y(0)$. (Full explicit computations omitted for brevity unless you'd like them fully spelled out.)

The constant is

\]
Thus $c=1$.  
The marginal:
\[
f_X(x)=\int_0^1 (x+y)\,dy = x + \frac12.
\]
Probability:
\[
\mathbb{P}(Y > X/2)=\int_0^1 \int_{x/2}^1 (x+y)\,dy\,dx.
\]
This evaluates to
\[
=\int_0^1 \left[\frac12(1 - x/2)^2 + x(1 - x/2)\right]dx = \frac{17}{24}.

\[
f_{Y\mid X}(y\mid x)=\frac{x+y}{x+\tfrac12}.

Compute:

\textbf{Problem 16.} Suppose $f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\lambda^2 e^{-\lambda(x+2y)}$ on the wedge
\[0<x,\ 0<y<x.\]
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item[(a)] Normalize the pdf.
	    \item[(b)] Compute $f_{_X}(x)$.
	    \item[(c)] Compute $P(Y<X/3)$.
	    \item[(d)] Compute $E[Y]$.
	\end{enumerate}

Region $0<y<x<\infty$.

Check normalization:
\[
\int_0^\infty\int_0^x \lambda^2 e^{-\lambda(x+2y)} dy\,dx
= \int_0^\infty \lambda^2 e^{-\lambda x}
\left[\frac12 e^{-\lambda x}-\frac12 e^{-2\lambda x}\right] dx.
\]

Simplify:
\[
=\frac{\lambda^2}{2}\int_0^\infty \left(e^{-2\lambda x} - e^{-3\lambda x}\right)dx
=\frac{\lambda^2}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2\lambda}-\frac{1}{3\lambda}\right)
=\frac{1}{12}.
\]

Thus multiply by 12 to normalize; true pdf is
\[
12\lambda^2 e^{-\lambda(x+2y)}.
\]

Marginal:
\[
f_X(x)=\int_0^x 12\lambda^2 e^{-\lambda(x+2y)} dy
=12\lambda^2 e^{-\lambda x}\frac{1-e^{-2\lambda x}}{2\lambda}.
\]

\[
\mathbb{P}(Y<X/3)
=\int_0^\infty \int_0^{x/3} 12\lambda^2 e^{-\lambda(x+2y)} dy\,dx.
\]

\[
E[Y]=\int_0^\infty\int_0^x y\cdot 12\lambda^2 e^{-\lambda(x+2y)} dy\,dx.
\]
