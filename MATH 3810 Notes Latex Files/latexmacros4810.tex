%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% IEEEeqnarray Notes %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%Any number of columns can be specified with IEEEeqnarray: {c} will give only one
%column with all entries centered, or {rCll} would add a fourth, left-justified
%column to use for comments. Moreover, beside l, c, r, L, C, R for math mode
%entries there are also s, t, u for left, centered, and right text mode entries.
%Additional space can be added with . and / and ? in increasing order.
%
%
%\begin{proof}
%This is a proof that ends
%with an equation array:
%\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{+rCl+x*}
%a & = & b + c \\
%& = & d + e. & \qedhere
%\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
%\end{proof}
%Note that the + in {+rCl+x*} denotes stretchable spaces, one on the left
%of the equations (which, if not specified, will be done automatically by
%IEEEeqnarray!) and one on the right of the equations. But now on the right,
%after the stretching column, we add an empty column x. This column will be
%only needed on the last line when we will put the \qedhere command there.
%Finally, we specify a *. This is a null-space that prevents IEEEeqnarray to
%add another unwanted +-space!


% The following environments enable custom numbering of theorems so that the numbers agree % with the numbering in the textbook being used. 
%
%  Usage examples:
%\begin{customthm}{2.2}\label{eight}
%Every theorem must be numbered by hand.
%\end{customthm}
%
%Here is a reference to theorem~\ref{eight}.

%\begin{customthm}{2.3}[Parenthetical comment]\label{nine}
