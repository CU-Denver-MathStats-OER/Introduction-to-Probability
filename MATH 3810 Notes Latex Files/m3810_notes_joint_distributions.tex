\section*{Motivation: Joint Distributions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Many experiments naturally produce more than one numerical outcome.
When we record these outcomes together, we obtain a \emph{pair} of random quantities
rather than a single one.

\medskip

\textbf{Example: Rolling two dice.}
When two fair dice are rolled, the outcome can be represented as an ordered pair
\[(X,Y) = (\text{first die}, \text{second die}).\]
Rather than studying $X$ or $Y$ alone, we may want to answer questions such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the probability that both dice show the same value?
\item What is the probability that the sum exceeds $9$?
\item Are the values of the two dice independent?
\end{itemize}

To answer these questions, we need a way to assign probabilities to \emph{pairs} of values.
This leads to the idea of a \emph{joint probability distribution}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Joint Random Variables:}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables defined on the same experiment.
The ordered pair
\[(X,Y)\]
is called a \textbf{\emph{joint random variable}}.
\end{defn}

\ni Each outcome of the experiment produces a numerical pair $(X,Y)\in\mathbb R^2$.
Probabilities are then assigned to events of the form
\[(X,Y)\in A,\]
where $A$ is a subset of the plane.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Discrete Joint Distributions:}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{defn}
A joint random variable $(X,Y)$ is called \textbf{\emph{discrete}} if it takes values
in a finite or countable set of ordered pairs.
The function
\[p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\P(X=x,\;Y=y)
\]
is called the \textbf{\emph{joint probability mass function (pmf)}}.
\end{defn}

\ni The joint pmf satisfies
\[p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)\ge 0,\qquad\sum_x\sum_y p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=1.\]

\ni Probabilities are computed by summing over the relevant pairs:
\[\P\big((X,Y)\in A\big)=\sum_{(x,y)\in A} p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y).\]

\ni Joint pmfs are often displayed in table form, which makes many probabilities
easy to compute directly.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Continuous Joint Distributions:}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{defn}
A joint random variable $(X,Y)$ is called \textbf{\emph{continuous}} if there exists a
nonnegative function $f_{X,Y}:\mathbb R^2\to[0,\infty)$ such that
\[\P\big((X,Y)\in A\big)=\int_A f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)\,dx\,dy\]
for all regions $A\subseteq\mathbb R^2$.
The function $f_{_{X,Y}}$ is called the \textbf{\emph{joint probability density function (pdf)}}.
\end{defn}

\ni In this setting, probabilities are interpreted geometrically:
they correspond to the volume under the surface $z=f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$ above the region $A$.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{From Joint Mass/Density to the Joint Distribution (and Back)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For a pair of random variables $(X,Y)$, there are two closely related objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \textbf{joint distribution function}
\[F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\P(X\le x,\;Y\le y),\]
\item and the \textbf{joint probability mass function} or \textbf{joint density function}.
\end{itemize}

This section shows how to move between these objects using summation,
integration, and differentiation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Discrete Case}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Suppose $(X,Y)$ is discrete with joint pmf $p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$.

\medskip

\ni The joint distribution function is obtained by summing the joint pmf over
all points in the lower-left quadrant:
\[F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\sum_{x_i\le x}\sum_{y_j\le y} p_{_{X,Y}}(x_i,y_j).
\]

\ni Thus, $F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$ accumulates the probabilities of all outcomes
for which $X\le x$ and $Y\le y$.

\medskip

\textbf{Recovering the pmf:} Because $F_{_{X,Y}}$ jumps at each point $(x,y)$, the joint pmf can be recovered
using finite differences:
\[p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)-F_{_{X,Y}}(x^-,y)-F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y^-)+F_{_{X,Y}}(x^-,y^-),\]
where $x^-$ and $y^-$ denote values just smaller than $x$ and $y$.

\medskip

\textbf{Example.}
For two fair dice,
\[F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\frac{1}{36}\,\#\{(i,j): i\le x,\; j\le y\},\]
and the pmf $p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=1/36$ is recovered by taking differences across the jumps of $F_{_{X,Y}}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Continuous Case}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Suppose $(X,Y)$ is continuous with joint pdf $f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$.

\medskip

\ni The joint distribution function is obtained by integrating the joint density
over the rectangle $(-\infty,x]\times(-\infty,y]$:
\[F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\int^{u=x}_{-\infty}\int^{v=y}_{-\infty}f_{_{X,Y}}(u,v)\,dv\,du.\]

\ni This integral accumulates probability over all outcomes with
$X\le x$ and $Y\le y$.

\medskip

\textbf{Recovering the density.}
If $F_{_{X,Y}}$ is differentiable, the joint density is obtained by taking partial derivatives:
\[f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x\,\partial y} F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y).\]

\medskip

\textbf{Example.}
Suppose
\[f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{lcl}
2&:& 0\le y\le x\le 1,\\
0&:& \text{Otherwise}.
\end{array}
\right.\]

Then
\[F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\int^{u=\min(x,1)}_{u=0}\int^{v=\min(y,u)}_{v=0} 2\,dv\,du,\]
and differentiating $F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$
recovers the joint density $f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$.

\section*{Worked Example: A Joint Density with Triangular Support}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let $(X,Y)$ have joint density
\[f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{ccl}
24x(1-x-y)&:& x\ge 0,\; y\ge 0,\; x+y\le 1,\\[2mm]
0&:& \text{Otherwise}.
\end{array}
\right.\]

The support is a triangular (wedge-shaped) region in the first quadrant.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{joint_density_plot.jpg}
\caption{Plot of Joint Density Function $f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$.}
\label{fig:jointdensity}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Problem 1: Verify that $f_{_{X,Y}}$ Is a Valid Joint Density}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We must check that $f_{X,Y}(x,y)\ge 0$ on its support and that
\[\int^{x=1}_{x=0}\ds\int^{y=1-x}_{y=0}24x(1-x-y)\,dy\,dx = 1.\]
Compute the inner integral:
\[\int^{y=1-x}_{y=0}24x(1-x-y)\,dy=24x\left[(1-x)y-\frac{y^2}{2}\right]^{y=1-x}_{y=0}=24x\frac{(1-x)^2}{2}.\]
Now integrate with respect to $x$:
\[\int^{x=1}_{x=0}12x(1-x)^2\,dx=12\int^{x=1}_{x=0}x-2x^2+x^3\,dx=12\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac23+\frac{1}{4}\right)=1.\]

So $f_{_{X,Y}}$ is a valid joint density. Here is a diagram of the support of the joint distribution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Problem 2: Compute the Joint Distribution Function}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We next compute the joint distribution function $F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$. Recall that
\vskip 2mm
\[F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\P\big(X\le x,\,Y\le y\big)=\ds\int^{u=x}_{-\infty}\ds\int^{v=y}_{-\infty}f_{_{X,Y}}(u,v)\,dvdu.\]
Because the support is a triangular region, the distribution function will have a piece-wise description and there are a number of different integrals that must be computed, depending on the location of the point $(x,y)$. See regions $A,B,C,D$, and $E$ in Figure~\ref{fig:jointdistregions}.

{\bf\emph{CDF Calculations for }}$f_{X,Y}(x,y)=24x(1-x-y)$:
\vskip 5mm
The joint density has support 
\[R_{_{X,Y}}=\{(x,y)\mid x\ge 0, y\ge 0, x+y \le 1\}.\]
We will provide calculations for three cases: Region A - $0 < x < 1$, $0 < y \le 1-x$ (inside the triangle); Region B - $0 < x < 1$, $1-x < y < 1$ (above the triangle); and Region C. 
\vskip 5mm
{\bf\emph{Region A:}} $0 < x < 1$, and $0 < y \le 1-x$ (Inside the Triangle)
\vskip 5mm
By definition of the CDF:
\[F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\P(X\le x,Y\le y)=\ds\int^{u=x}_{u=0}\ds\int^{v=y}_{v=0}f_{_{X,Y}}(u,v)\,dvdu\]
\vskip 2mm
\emph{Step 1: Inner integral over $v$}
\[\ds\int^{v=y}_{v=0}24u(1-u-v)\,dv=24u\int^{v=y}_{v=0}(1-u-v)\,dv=24u\Big[(1-u)v-\frac{v^2}{2}\Big]^{v=y}_{v=0}
=24u\left((1-u)y-\frac{y^2}{2}\right)\]
\vskip 2mm
\emph{Step 2: Outer integral over $u$}
\[\ds\int^{u=x}_{u=0}24u\left((1-u)y-\frac{y^2}{2}\right)\,du=\ds\int^{u=x}_{u=0}24u(1-u)y-12uy^2\,du\]
\vskip 2mm
Evaluating this integral with respect to $u$ gives us $F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=12x^2y-8x^3y-6x^2y^2$ when $0<x,y$ and $x+y<1$.
\vskip 5mm
---
\vskip 5mm

{\bf\emph{Region B:}} $x+y>1$, $0<x<1$, and $0<y<1$ (above the triangle)
\vskip 5mm
Here $(x,y)$ lies outside the triangular support (see Figure~\ref{fig:integrationregionB}) and we use two integrals. 
\[F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\ds\int^{u=1-y}_{u=0}\ds\int^{v=y}_{v=0}24u(1-u-v)\,dvdu+\ds\int^{u=x}_{u=1-y}\ds\int^{v=1-u}_{v=0}24u(1-u-v)\,dvdu\]

We leave the computations to the reader and find when $x+y>1$, $0<x<1$, and $0<y<1$ we have
\[F_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=6x^2-8x^3+3x^4+4y^3-3y^4+2y(2-3y+y^3)-1.\]

\subsection*{Problem 3: Compute $\mathbb P(X>Y)$}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The event $\{X>Y\}$ corresponds to the region $0\le y\le x,\quad x+y\le 1$. See Figure~\ref{fig:xgreaterthany}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=4]

\node at (0.45,0.15) {$X>Y$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Region corresponding to $X>Y$.}
\label{fig:xgreaterthany}
\end{figure}

We compute
\[\P(X>Y)=\int^{x=1}_{x=0}\int^{y=\min(x,1-x)}_{y=0} 24x(1-x-y)\,dydx.\]

Split at $x=\tfrac{1}{2}$:
\[\P(X>Y)=\ds\int^{x=1/2}_{x=0}\ds\int^{y=x}_{y=0}24x(1-x-y)\,dydx+
\ds\int^{x=1}_{x=1/2}\ds\int^{y=1-x}_{y=0}24x(1-x-y)\,dydx.\]

Evaluating both integrals gives
\[\boxed{\P(X>Y)=\frac34.}\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Problem 4: Compute $\mathbb P(X>\tfrac{1}{2})$}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The region is $\frac12 \le x \le 1$, and $0\le y\le 1-x$. See Figure~\ref{fig:xgreaterhalf}

		\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Region corresponding to $X>\tfrac12$.}
\label{fig:xgreaterhalf}

Compute
\[\P\left(X>\tfrac12\right)=\int^{x=1}_{x=1/2}\int^{y=1-x}_{y=0}24x(1-x-y)\,dydx.\]
which gives us
\[\P\left(X>\tfrac12\right)=\int_{1/2}^ 12x(1-x)^2\,dx=\boxed{\frac{5}{16}.}\]


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Key Takeaways}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item Validity of a joint density is checked by integrating over its support.
\item Joint probabilities are computed by integrating $f_{X,Y}$ over geometric regions.
\item Visualizing the support makes limits of integration immediate.
\item Different probability questions correspond to different subregions of the same support.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Marginal Distributions: Interpretation, Visuals, and Examples}

The joint distribution of $(X,Y)$ describes how two variables behave together.
A \emph{marginal distribution} describes the behavior of one variable alone,
ignoring the other.

Suppose $(X,Y)$ has a discrete joint pmf $p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$, displayed as a table.
Marginalization corresponds to summing highlighted cells. See Figure~\ref{discretemarginals}.

\textbf{Example (Two Fair Dice).}
For two fair dice, $p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=1/36$ for all $x,y\in\{1,\dots,6\}$.
Summing across any row yields $p_{_X}(x)=1/6$, and summing down any column yields
$p_Y(y)=1/6$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Continuous Case:}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now suppose $(X,Y)$ has a joint pdf $f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)$.
To obtain the marginal density of $X$, we integrate the joint density
along a thin vertical strip.

\medskip

\ni Fix a value $x$ and consider the strip $x \le X \le x+\delta$. This strip includes \emph{all values of $Y$} compatible with $X$ in that range. The probability of landing in the strip is approximately
\[\int f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)\,\delta\,dy.\]

\ni Dividing by $\delta$ and letting $\delta\to 0$ yields
\[f_{_X}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)\,dy.\]

\medskip

\caption{$\P(x < X \le x+\delta)$ over $R_{_{X,Y}} = \{(x,y) \mid 0 \le y \le x \le 1\}$}
\label{fig:contmarginal}
\end{figure}

\ni The shaded strip captures all outcomes whose $x$-coordinate lies in
$[x,x+\delta]$, regardless of $y$, but only where the joint density is nonzero.

\medskip

\textbf{Example (Triangular Support).}
Suppose $(X,Y)$ has joint pdf
\[f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{lcl}
2&:& 0\le y\le x\le 1,\\
0&:& \text{otherwise}.
\end{array}
\right.\]

\ni The marginal density of $X$ is
\[f_{_X}(x)=\int^{y=x 2}_{y=0}\,dy=2x,\qquad 0\le x\le 1.\]

\ni Thus $X$ has an increasing density on $[0,1]$, reflecting the expanding vertical
slice of the triangular support as $x$ increases.

\medskip

In both the discrete and continuous settings, marginalization corresponds to
\emph{collapsing the joint distribution onto one axis} by summing or integrating
over the other variable.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Example 3: Uniform Density on a Rectangle}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Suppose $(X,Y)$ has joint pdf
\[f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{lcl}
1&:& 0\le x\le 1,\; 0\le y\le 1, \\[2mm]
0&:& \text{otherwise}.
\end{array}
\right.\]

\ni The marginal density of $X$ is
\[f_{_X}(x)=\int_0^1 1\,dy = 1,\qquad 0\le x\le 1.\]

\ni Thus $X$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$.
An identical calculation shows that $Y$ is also uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Example 4: Marginal Density of $Y$ when $f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=24x(1-x-y)$.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Returning to a previous worked example with $f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=24x(1-x-y)$, the marginal density of $Y$ is obtained by integrating the joint density over $x$:

\[f_{_Y}(y)=\int^{x=1-y}_{x=0}f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)\,dx=\int^{x=1-y}_{x=0}24x(1-x-y)\,dx,\quad 0\le y \le 1.\]

\textbf{Compute the integral:}

\[\int^{x=1-y}_{x=0}24x(1-x-y)\,dx=24\int^{x=1-y}_{x=0}x - x^2 - xy\,dx
=24\left[\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^3}{3}-\frac{y x^2}{2}\right]^{x=1-y}_{x=0}.\]

So the marginal density is:

\[\boxed{f_{_Y}(y)=4(1-y)^3,\quad 0 \le y \le 1.}\]

\subsection*{Example 5: Distribution Function $F_{_Y}(y)$ when $f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=24x(1-x-y)$.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The distribution function is

\[F_{_Y}(y)=\P(Y\le y)=\int^{t=y}_{t=0}f_{_Y}(t)\,dt = \int^{t=y}_{t=0}4(1-t)^3\,dt.\]

Compute:

\[\int^{t=y}_{t=0}4(1-t)^3\,dt=-(1-t)^4\Big|^{t=y}_{t=0}=-(1-y)^4+1^4=1-(1-y)^4.\]

\[\boxed{F_{_Y}(y) = 1 - (1-y)^4, \quad 0 \le y \le 1.}\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Independence of Random Variables}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Two random variables are called \emph{independent} if knowing the value of one provides
no information about the other.

\medskip

In practice, independence is identified through simple factorization tests.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Discrete Case}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If $(X,Y)$ is discrete, then $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if
\[
p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=p_{_X}(x)\,p_{_Y}(y)\qquad\text{for all }x,y.\]

\ni When this condition holds, the joint pmf table can be reconstructed
from its row and column sums.

\medskip

\textbf{Example (Two Fair Dice):} For two fair dice,
\[p_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=\frac{1}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{6}=p_{_X}(x)p_{_Y}(y),\]
so the outcomes of the two dice are independent.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Continuous Case}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If $(X,Y)$ is continuous, then $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if
\[f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=f_{_X}(x)\,f_{_Y}(y)\qquad\text{for all }(x,y).\]

\ni In this case, the joint density separates into a product of two one-dimensional densities.

\medskip

\textbf{Example:} If $X$ and $Y$ are independent and uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, then
\[f_{_{X,Y}}(x,y)=1,\qquad 0\le x\le 1,\;0\le y\le 1,\]
corresponding to a constant density over a rectangle.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Geometric Interpretation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\ni Independence has a clear geometric meaning.

\begin{itemize}
\item In the discrete case, probabilities factor across rows and columns of the table.
\item In the continuous case, the joint density forms a \emph{rectangular surface}
with no interaction between $x$ and $y$.
\end{itemize}

\ni Non-rectangular supports or densities that do not factor indicate dependence.

\medskip

Independence is therefore a strong structural property of a joint distribution,
not merely a numerical coincidence.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
\textbf{Solution.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Since $f_{X,Y}(x,y)\ge0$ and
\[
\int_0^1\int_0^1 6y(1-x)\,dy\,dx
=6\int_0^1(1-x)\,dx\int_0^1 y\,dy
=6\cdot\frac12\cdot\frac12=1,
\]
the function is a valid joint density.

\item The support is the unit square $[0,1]\times[0,1]$.

\item
\[
f_X(x)=\int_0^1 6y(1-x)\,dy
=3(1-x),\qquad 0\le x\le1.
\]

\[
\boxed{f_X(x)=3(1-x)}
\]

\item
\[
\P(X\le\tfrac12)=\int_0^{1/2}3(1-x)\,dx
=\frac{9}{8}.
\]

\[

\]
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\item
\textbf{Solution.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\[
f_X(x)=\int_0^x 2\,dy = 2x,\qquad
f_Y(y)=\int_y^1 2\,dx = 2(1-y).
\]

\[
\boxed{f_X(x)=2x,\quad f_Y(y)=2(1-y)}
\]

\item
\[
\P(Y\le\tfrac14)=\int_0^{1/4}2(1-y)\,dy=\frac{7}{16}.
\]

\[
\boxed{\P(Y\le\tfrac14)=\tfrac{7}{16}}
\]

\item The density increases with $x$ because larger values of $x$ allow a wider vertical range for $y$.

p_X(x)=\sum_y p_{X,Y}(x,y)=\frac{2}{10},\qquad
p_Y(y)=\sum_x p_{X,Y}(x,y)=\frac{5}{10}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The support is the region below $y=x^2$ for $0\le x\le1$.

\item
\[

\item By symmetry,
\[
\P(Y>X)=\frac12.
\]

\[
\boxed{\P(Y>X)=\tfrac12}
\]

\item
\[
\P(X+Y>\tfrac12)=1-\int_0^{1/2}\int_0^{1/2-x}24x(1-x-y)\,dy\,dx.

Evaluating,
\[
\P(X+Y>\tfrac12)=\frac{23}{24}.
\]

\[
