\section*{Normal Random Variables}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent The normal distribution arises naturally when we sum many independent, small random effects.  
Suppose we have a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables 
$X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ with finite mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  
By the Central Limit Theorem, for large $n$, the normalized sum
\[
S_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{X_i - \mu}{\sigma} 
\]
approaches a \emph{standard normal distribution} $Z \sim N(0,1)$. More generally, a continuous random variable $X$ is \textbf{normal} with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ if its density is
\[
f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\Big[-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big], \quad x \in \mathbb{R}.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Theoretical Facts:}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Symmetry:} The density is symmetric about $\mu$.
\item \textbf{Standardization:} If $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, then
\[
Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1).
\]
\item \textbf{Moment Properties:} For $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$,
\[
\mathbb{E}[X] = \mu, \quad \mathrm{Var}(X) = \sigma^2.
\]
\item \textbf{Linear transformations:} For $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, if $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, then
\[
Y = aX + b \sim N(a\mu+b, a^2\sigma^2).
\]
\item \textbf{Sum of independent normals:} If $X_1 \sim N(\mu_1,\sigma_1^2)$
and $X_2 \sim N(\mu_2,\sigma_2^2)$ are independent, then
\[
X_1 + X_2 \sim N(\mu_1+\mu_2, \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2).
\]
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Calculations: Expectation and Variance}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent
Let $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$. Then, by definition,
\[\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f_{_X}(x) dx
= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)} dx.\]

Make the substitution $y = (x-\mu)/\sigma$:
\[x = \sigma y + \mu, \quad dx = \sigma dy\]

Then
\[\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (\sigma y + \mu) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-y^2/2} dy
=\mu\underbrace{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-y^2/2} dy}_{\substack{\text{Integral of Density}\\ \text{Equals One}}} + \sigma\underbrace{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-y^2/2} dy}_{\substack{\text{Integral of Odd Funnction}\\ \text{Equals Zero}}}
= \mu.\]

Similarly,
\[\mathrm{Var}(X) = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^2] = \sigma^2 \mathbb{E}[Y^2] = \sigma^2.\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Standardization and Probability Calculations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent
To compute probabilities, we standardize:
\[Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1).\]

Then, for any $a<b$:
\[\P(a \le X \le b) = \P\Big(\frac{a-\mu}{\sigma} \le Z \le \frac{b-\mu}{\sigma}\Big).\]

Tables or software can then be used to evaluate probabilities for $Z$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Visualizing the Normal Distribution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent
We often visualize probabilities by shading areas under the standard normal density curve.  
Here, $Z \sim N(0,1)$, with density
\[f_{_Z}(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}, \quad z \in \mathbb{R}.\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Key Visual Insights}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item About 68\% of the probability lies within one standard deviation of the mean ($\mu \pm \sigma$).  
\item About 95\% lies within two standard deviations ($\mu \pm 2\sigma$).  
\item About 99.7\% lies within three standard deviations ($\mu \pm 3\sigma$).  

\item Symmetry: the area to the left of $\mu$ equals the area to the right.  
\item Standardization allows us to reuse this figure for any normal $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ by computing $z=(X-\mu)/\sigma$.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Practice Example:}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent
Suppose $X \sim N(100, 16)$ (mean $100$, variance $16$).

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Find $\P(X>108)$.
\item[(b)] Find $\P(92 \le X \le 108)$.
\item[(c)] Compute the standardized value $z$ for $X=108$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solutionbox}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] $z = (108-100)/4 = 2$, so $\P(X>108) = \P(Z>2) \approx 0.0228$.
\item[(b)] $z_1=(92-100)/4=-2$, $z_2=(108-100)/4=2$, so $\P(92\le X\le 108) = \P(-2\le Z\le 2) \approx 0.9544$.
\item[(c)] $z = (108-100)/4 = 2$.
\end{itemize}
\end{solutionbox}
