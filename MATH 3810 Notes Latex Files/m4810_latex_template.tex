	\item This is an open note \assessmenttype. You may use your notes on this \assessmenttype but may not use your book. All electronics must be turned off during the exam.
	\item Write all answers in the spaces provided on the \assessmenttype.
	\item Throughout the \assessmenttype, show your work so that your reasoning is clear. Otherwise no credit will be given.
	\item If you are asked to \emph{find} or \emph{write} a formula or an expression without proof, you do not need to show any work but must present your solution using correct mathematical notation.
	\item If you are asked to \emph{give} or \emph{cite} a definition or a result that we discussed in class, you must use complete sentences, correct mathematical notation, and state all conditions or assumptions.
	\item If you are asked to \emph{prove} or \emph{show} a formula or a result, you must give a proof using complete sentences and correct mathematical notation. If you can correctly cite a result that we have proved in class or that is proven in the book, you can use it and do not have to prove it again. 
	\item The following table gives the total points for each problem on this \assessmenttype.
